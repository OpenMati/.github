**Freedom and sovereignty of individual cognition. Diversity and evolution of collective intelligence.**

</div>


### âœ¨ Vision

Mati.AI builds a **decentralized RL network** where Cognis can evolve, interact, and combine with others â€” while remaining under the control of their originator.

> **Cognis** is a self-sovereign unit of cognition â€” representing an individualâ€™s reasoning, knowledge, and independent ideas.  

We believe that **large language models centralize cognition** â€” shaping how ideas spread and narrowing diversity.  
Mati.AI is building the counterweight: a **network architecture that safeguards individual freedom** and enables **collective evolution of intelligence**.

- **Individual Freedom & Sovereignty**  
  Preserve autonomy of thought: no single entity controls access to your models or data.  
  Compute, train, and propagate your Cognis under your own terms.

- **Diversity & Evolution**  
  Encourage a vibrant ecosystem of models that fork, merge, and challenge one another â€”  
  driving continuous evolution of reasoning and ideas.


### ðŸš€ Our Path Forward

**Phase 1 â€” Decentralized Compute & Protocols**  
- Peer-to-peer compute layer for sandboxed training & inference  
- Open protocols for task scheduling, data/model exchange, and provenance  
- Minimal viable model to validate decentralized workflows  

**Phase 2 â€” User-Controlled Models**  
- Personal micro-models trained on local data  
- Privacy-preserving execution (E2E encryption, ZK proofs optional)  
- Token & reputation incentives for compute, data, and model contributions  

**Phase 3 â€” Cognis Graph**  
- Cross-model reasoning through a decentralized graph  
- Fork/merge/vote workflows for community-driven model evolution  
- Incentives to promote diversity and prevent homogenization  

**Phase 4 â€” Multi-Model Intelligence**  
- Emergent collaboration across networks of models  
- Decentralized governance of protocol, model integration, and compute  
- Towards a censorship-resistant, self-evolving cognitive layer
